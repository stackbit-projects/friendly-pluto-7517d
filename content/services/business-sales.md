We offer multiple ways to invest including fixed no risk limited returns as well as variable returns through profit sharing.  These investments options listed below are only available to accredited investors. Any investor wanting to invest with us will have to verify their accreditation investor status every year through third party. The cost of the accreditation is $50/year. However investors who stay invested with us get a refund of this accreditation fee.

## Fixed Returns

We offer the ability to invest your assets with us for a fixed return currently 6% per annum and a 2% bonus for every year the money stays invested. We evaluate the fixed rate of return every 6 months. If we reduce our return and you decide to withdraw your deposit you will be entitled to the 2% bonus.

Your money is not locked. You may submit a withdrawal request at any time. However it takes us 14 days to process the withdrawal as we invest your money in complex financial instruments which typically take approximately 7-10 business days to dissolve. Additional 2-3 business days for ACH transfer.

## Variable Returns

With variable returns you buy our stock at the current book value. We distribute part of our profits to every shareholder as  dividends on a quarterly basis while a part of it is invested back into the business increasing the book value of the shares. You may redeem your shares by selling them to us at the current book value.

Book values are updated every week to reflect current investment gains and dividends paid till date
